// Help content for every public OmniCam node, keyed by comfyClass.

// One entry, one place to edit. The selection-toolbar "?" button
// (web-src/help/toolbar.js) shows whichever entry matches the selected node.
// Content is plain English on purpose (see web-src/help/schema.js) rather than
// routed through t(): a paragraph-length reference does not carry across the
// FR catalogue the way short UI chrome strings do, and check:locales does not
// require it (missing translations only lower coverage, they never fail).
